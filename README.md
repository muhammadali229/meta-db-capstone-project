# Little Lemon Restaurant Capstone Project

Welcome to the Capstone Project for the Little Lemon Restaurant database and client development course. In this course, I will utilize database engineering experience gained from meta database engineer courses to design and implement a comprehensive solution for Little Lemon Restaurant.

## Course Overview

The Capstone project is an opportunity to showcase my skills and address a real-world problem. i will combine the knowledge acquired throughout the program to create a database and client for Little Lemon Restaurant. The key aspects covered in this course include:

- Setting up a database project
- Adding sales reports
- Creating a table booking system
- Working with data analytics and visualization
- Developing a database client

## Skills and Tools

Throughout the course, I will demonstrate proficiency with the following tools and software:

- Git
- MySQL Workbench
- Tableau
- Python

## Module Breakdown

### Module One: Database Setup and ER Diagram

In this module, I will introduce yourself to the Little Lemon project environment and help set up the database. Key tasks include:

- Setting up a repository
- Configuring a MySQL instance server in MySQL Workbench
- Creating and implementing an ER diagram data model
- Committing the project to Git

### Module Two: Sales Reports and Table Booking System

Building on the foundation from Module One, this module focuses on managing sales reports and implementing a table booking system. Tasks include:

- Creating a virtual table using JOINs
- Crafting optimized queries for data management and analysis
- Designing SQL queries for checking, adding, and updating bookings
- Testing and committing progress to Git

### Module Three: Data Visualization and Database Clients

This module involves utilizing Tableau for data visualization and creating a Python-based database client. Key activities include:

- Setting up a Tableau Workspace and building an interactive dashboard
- Developing a database client using Python with query functions
- Committing progress to Git

### Module Four: Review and Comparison

In the final module, you will:

- Review your Little Lemon database
- Present your database to another learner for feedback
- Receive and provide feedback on another learner's database
- Review an exemplar of the Little Lemon database for comparison

By the end of the course, you will have demonstrated your ability to integrate various skills and technologies to solve real-world problems in the realm of database engineering. Good luck with your Capstone project!
